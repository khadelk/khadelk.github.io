	<h1>About me</h1>
	<p>I'm Sarah. I'm a developer!

		In the past year I've been able to combine my skills in civics and tech to work as an application developer for the University of Iowas' Public Policy Center. There, I have developed data processing scripts using PostgreSQL and Python, developed our website using Drupal, PHP and JavaScript and developed various projects with researchers using JavaScript frameworks such as Sveltekit.
		
		Iâ€™m also a DJ on a radio show, timely();, where I get to share my love for music and a member of Her Tech Collaborative, a local group for women in tech. </p>
