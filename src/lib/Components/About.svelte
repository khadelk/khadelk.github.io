	<p class="text-lg">I'm Sarah, a full stack application developer based in Iowa City, IA.

		In the past year I've been able to combine my skills in civics and tech to work at the University of Iowa Public Policy Center. There, I have developed data processing scripts using PostgreSQL and Python, developed the <a class="text-denim-blue transition hover:text-cinnamon-satin" target="_blank" href="https://ppc.uiowa.edu/">University of Iowa Public Policy Center</a> website using Drupal, PHP and JavaScript and worked on various projects with researchers using JavaScript frameworks such as SvelteKit.<br><br>
		
		When I'm not obsessively coding, I DJ on a radio show, <a class="text-denim-blue transition hover:text-cinnamon-satin" target="_blank" href="https://krui.fm/events/timely/">timely();</a>, where I get to share my love for music and am a member of Her Tech Collaborative, a local group for women in tech. </p>
