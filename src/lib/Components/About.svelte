	<p class="text-lg">I'm Sarah, a full stack developer based in Chicago, IL.

		I spend my time at Mess building sites for a range of clients using Wordpress, BuilderIO, Javascript, Vue, PHP and a range of other languages, frameworks and content management systems. <br><br>

		Before that, I was able to combine my skills in civics and tech to work at the University of Iowa Public Policy Center. There, I developed data processing scripts using PostgreSQL and Python, developed the <a class="text-denim-blue transition hover:text-cinnamon-satin" target="_blank" href="https://ppc.uiowa.edu/">University of Iowa Public Policy Center</a> website using Drupal, PHP and JavaScript and worked on various projects with researchers using JavaScript frameworks such as SvelteKit.<br><br>
		
		When I'm not obsessively coding, I play guitar, bake, and explore Chicago. </p>
